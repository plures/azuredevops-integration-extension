Contribution guidelines

Key conventions maintained by this project:

- TypeScript ESM imports: In source TypeScript files we use explicit ".js" extensions on import specifiers where the import is preserved to runtime (e.g. activation). This matches `moduleResolution: NodeNext` and ensures the emitted ESM JS is correct. Use `import type` for purely type-only imports when possible.

- Build outputs: The published package should include only runtime artifacts (dist/, media/) and not the entire src/ tree. Use `npm run build` and verify artifacts in `dist/` and `media/`.

- Staged deletions: Files moved to `.delete/` are preserved snapshots. Convert any useful code (e.g. timer harness) into tests under `tests/` before removing the original.

- Running locally:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run webview:dev` to run Vite dev server for the webview.
  - `npm run watch` and then use the "Extension: Watch" launch configuration to debug in VS Code.

- Tests:
  - `npm test` runs Mocha tests under `tests/`.

## GitHub Copilot Setup

This repository includes comprehensive instructions for GitHub Copilot coding agent:

- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Main instructions file containing:
  - Repository structure and key files
  - Build, test, and development workflows
  - FSM-first architectural principles
  - Security considerations and best practices
- `.github/instructions/vscode-extension.instructions.md` - Detailed architectural guardrails

These instructions help Copilot coding agent understand the repository structure, build processes, and architectural patterns to provide better assistance with development tasks.

If in doubt, open an issue or a draft pull request describing your planned change and its impact on extension activation or webview messages.
