Developer Policy & Onboarding

Purpose

- Centralize expectations for contributors: coding standards, testing, CI gating, commit message rules, and release processes.

Quick Setup

1. Node: Use Node v22.19.0 (LTS) or greater.
2. Install: npm ci
3. Bootstrap dev hooks: npm run prepare
4. Start webview dev: npm run webview:dev
5. Run extension in debug: use the provided launch configurations in .vscode/launch.json

Code style & formatting

- Formatting: Prettier (project .prettierrc) â€” run via npm run format.
- Linting: ESLint configured for TypeScript; run via npm run lint.
- EditorConfig: project .editorconfig enforces tabs/spaces and EOL.

Testing

- Unit tests: Mocha + Chai in tests/. Run via npm test.
- Integration tests: @vscode/test-electron (smoke tests for activation + webview round-trip). Will be run in CI for PRs.
- PRs must include tests for new logic or UI changes.

Commit & PR conventions

- Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits (enforced by commitlint): e.g. feat(scope): add something
- Pull requests should have clear description, tests, and an assigned reviewer. Please rebase on main and keep PRs small.

Pre-commit hooks

- Changes will be auto-formatted and lint-checked via husky + lint-staged before commit.

CI gating

- PRs must pass: build, webview build, unit tests, lint, and format checks before merging.
- The main branch should always be green.

Release process

- Use semantic-release or manual tagging to create releases. Release pipeline will create VSIX and publish to Marketplace only from tagged releases.

Security & dependencies

- Dependabot is enabled for automated dependency updates; run `npm audit` as part of the release checklist.

Developer tips

- Use the staged .delete for archival code; do not remove until tests and CI pass.
- If you need to change message contracts between extension and webview, update tests that assert message shapes first.
