# Foundation Build Progress

## Goal
Build sustainable, testable, maintainable architecture with guard rails to prevent regressions.

---

## Phase 1: Validation Infrastructure ✅

### Completed
- ✅ Architecture discipline documentation
- ✅ TDD template and workflow
- ✅ XState v5 validation script
- ✅ Type-safe helpers for XState
- ✅ ESLint rules for file size
- ✅ Post-mortem analysis
- ✅ **Fixed all 9 XState violations** across 3 machine files
- ✅ **Build succeeds** without errors
- ✅ **Validation passes** - all machines valid

### Scripts Added
```json
{
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
  "validate:machines": "tsx scripts/validate-xstate-machines.ts",
  "validate:all": "npm run type-check && npm run validate:machines",
  "lint:file-size": "npx eslint src --ext ts --rule 'max-lines: [error, 500]'"
}
```

---

## Phase 2: Test Infrastructure (In Progress)

### Next Steps
1. ⬜ Create `tests/features/` directory
2. ⬜ Add vitest configuration
3. ⬜ Write timer integration test
4. ⬜ Verify test fails (RED phase)
5. ⬜ Run test after build to verify GREEN

### Test Framework Setup
```bash
npm install -D vitest @vitest/ui
```

### Sample Test Structure
```
tests/
  features/
    timer.test.ts          # Timer feature tests
    edit-dialog.test.ts    # Edit dialog tests
    branch-linking.test.ts # Branch linking tests
  utils/
    time-formatting.test.ts  # Pure function tests
```

---

## Phase 3: Module Extraction (Pending)

### Target Structure
```
src/
  features/
    timer/
      index.ts           # Public API
      types.ts           # Interfaces
      machine.ts         # FSM (< 200 lines)
      persistence.ts     # Save/restore logic
      ui-integration.ts  # VSCode integration
      timer.test.ts      # Co-located tests
```

### Benefits
- **Small files**: Each < 300 lines
- **Single responsibility**: Each file has one job
- **Testable**: Pure functions easy to test
- **Maintainable**: Easy to understand and modify

---

## Phase 4: Pre-Commit Enforcement (Pending)

### Update `.husky/pre-commit`
```bash
#!/bin/sh
npm run validate:all || exit 1
npm run test:feature || exit 1
```

### Benefits
- Catches XState violations before commit
- Runs tests before commit
- Prevents broken code from entering git history

---

## Immediate Win

**Before**: 9 XState violations causing crashes  
**After**: 0 violations, all machines valid, build succeeds

**Next**: Add tests so we never break features again.

---

## Timeline

- **Day 1** (Today): ✅ Validation infrastructure
- **Day 2** (Tomorrow): Tests + timer module extraction  
- **Day 3**: Apply pattern to other features + pre-commit hooks

---

## Success Metrics

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All state machines pass validation
- [ ] All features have integration tests
- [ ] Test coverage > 80% for features
- [ ] No file > 500 lines
- [ ] Pre-commit validation enabled

### Developer Experience
- [ ] Can add features without fear
- [ ] Tests catch regressions immediately
- [ ] Small modules easy to understand
- [ ] Clear error messages from validation

---

## Current Status

✅ **Foundation laid**  
✅ **Validation working**  
✅ **Build succeeds**  
⬜ **Tests needed**  
⬜ **Modules extracted**  
⬜ **Pre-commit enabled**

**Next**: Write timer integration test.
