Developer CLI (dev-cli)

We provide small npm scripts and a lightweight dev CLI to help common tasks:

Usage:

- npm run watch # watch TypeScript + esbuild bundling for the extension
- npm run test # run unit tests

We provide `scripts/dev-cli.js` to automate environment checks and common tasks. Webview assets are static and committed under `media/webview/`.
