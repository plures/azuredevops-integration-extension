# Connection FSM Testing Guide

## ðŸ”— Testing Connection State Machine Integration

We've successfully implemented Connection FSM architecture that replaces the complex `ensureActiveConnection()` function with structured state management.

## What We've Built

### âœ… Connection FSM Components
1. **`connectionMachine.ts`** - State machine with connection lifecycle:
   - `disconnected` â†’ `authenticating` â†’ `creating_client` â†’ `creating_provider` â†’ `connected`
   - Handles PAT and Entra ID authentication flows
   - Proper error handling and retry logic

2. **`ConnectionFSMManager.ts`** - Manages multiple connection actors:
   - Creates and manages connection state machines per connection
   - Provides async connection API
   - Handles cleanup and debugging

3. **`ConnectionAdapter.ts`** - Backward compatibility layer:
   - Maintains existing `ensureActiveConnection()` interface
   - Feature flag support for gradual migration
   - Validation between FSM and legacy behavior

4. **Integration with activation.ts**:
   - Feature flag: `experimental.useConnectionFSM`
   - Debug commands for FSM inspection
   - Proper cleanup on deactivation

## Testing Steps

### Step 1: Enable Connection FSM

Add to your VS Code settings:
```json
{
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.experimental.useConnectionFSM": true,
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.experimental.useFSM": true,
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.enableFSMInspector": true
}
```

### Step 2: Reload VS Code Window

**Important**: Connection FSM initializes on extension activation
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` â†’ "Developer: Reload Window"
- Watch Debug Console for Connection FSM startup messages

### Expected Console Output
```
ðŸ”— Connection FSM enabled - initializing connection state machines
âœ… Connection FSM initialized successfully
[Connection FSM] Enabled
[Connection Adapter] FSM enabled
```

### Step 3: Test Connection FSM Commands

Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` and test these commands:

#### 1. "Azure DevOps: Show Connection FSM Status"
Should display current connection states:
```json
{
  "isEnabled": true,
  "activeConnections": 0,
  "connectionStates": {}
}
```

#### 2. "Azure DevOps: Test Connection FSM"
- Tests the complete connection flow
- Should attempt to connect using FSM
- May show warnings if no connections configured

#### 3. "Azure DevOps: Validate Connection FSM Sync"  
- Compares FSM vs legacy behavior
- Validates backward compatibility
- Reports any inconsistencies

### Step 4: Test Connection Operations

#### Setup a Connection First
1. Use existing "Setup or Manage Connections" command
2. Configure at least one Azure DevOps connection
3. Note the connection ID for testing

#### Test Connection FSM Flow
With Connection FSM enabled:
1. **Switch connections**: Test connection switching in webview
2. **Authentication**: Test PAT authentication flow
3. **Error scenarios**: Test with invalid PAT to see error handling
4. **Retry logic**: Test automatic retry on failures

### Step 5: Monitor FSM State Transitions

#### Debug Console Monitoring
Watch for Connection FSM messages:
```
[Connection FSM] connecting-123 state: { value: "authenticating", isConnected: false }
[Connection FSM] connecting-123 state: { value: "creating_client", isConnected: false }  
[Connection FSM] connecting-123 state: { value: "connected", isConnected: true }
[Connection FSM] connecting-123 connected successfully
```

#### Error Scenarios
Test error handling:
```
[Connection FSM] connecting-123 state: { value: "auth_failed", lastError: "PAT not found" }
[Connection FSM] connecting-123 authentication failed: PAT not found
```

### Step 6: Performance Validation

#### Connection Time Testing
- **Measure connection establishment time** 
- **Compare FSM vs legacy performance**
- Should be similar speed with better reliability

#### Memory Usage
- Monitor memory with Connection FSM enabled
- Should be comparable to legacy implementation
- Check for proper actor cleanup

## Validation Checklist

### âœ… Functionality Tests
- [ ] Extension activates with Connection FSM enabled
- [ ] Connection FSM status command works
- [ ] Test connection command executes
- [ ] Validation command compares behaviors
- [ ] Existing connection operations work identically
- [ ] Error handling works correctly
- [ ] Retry logic functions properly

### âœ… Integration Tests  
- [ ] Works with existing timer FSM
- [ ] Compatible with Application FSM
- [ ] Proper cleanup on deactivation
- [ ] No interference with other extension features

### âœ… Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Invalid PAT handled gracefully
- [ ] Network failures trigger retry logic
- [ ] Authentication failures show proper errors
- [ ] Timeout scenarios handled correctly

## Architecture Benefits Demonstrated

### ðŸŽ¯ Structured State Management
- **Predictable transitions**: Connection can only be in valid states
- **Clear error paths**: Each failure type has specific handling
- **Retry logic**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Debugging**: Visual state transitions in console

### ðŸ”’ Improved Reliability
- **Race condition elimination**: FSM prevents invalid state combinations  
- **Proper cleanup**: Resources cleaned up on disconnection
- **Error recovery**: Structured error handling and fallback
- **Authentication flow**: Separate handling for PAT vs Entra ID

### ðŸ§ª Maintainable Code
- **Single responsibility**: Each state handles one concern
- **Testable**: State machines can be tested in isolation
- **Observable**: All state changes are logged and traceable
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new authentication methods or states

## Troubleshooting

### Connection FSM Not Starting
1. **Check setting**: Ensure `useConnectionFSM` is `true`
2. **Check console**: Look for initialization messages
3. **Reload window**: FSM only starts on activation

### Commands Not Working
1. **Verify FSM enabled**: Use status command first
2. **Check connections**: Need existing connections for testing
3. **Look for errors**: Check Debug Console for error messages

### Performance Issues
1. **Compare modes**: Test with FSM disabled vs enabled
2. **Check actors**: Monitor number of active connection actors
3. **Memory usage**: Use VS Code dev tools to monitor

## Next Steps After Testing

Once Connection FSM validation is complete:

1. **âœ… Phase 3 Complete**: Connection state management with FSM
2. **Phase 4**: Implement Authentication FSM for device code flows
3. **Phase 5**: Replace `handleMessage()` with FSM event routing  
4. **Phase 6**: Implement Data Sync FSM for work item loading
5. **Phase 7**: Complete global state elimination

## Success Indicators

Connection FSM is working correctly when:
- [ ] All existing connection functionality works identically
- [ ] State transitions are visible in console logs  
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance remains comparable to legacy
- [ ] Debug commands provide useful information
- [ ] No memory leaks from connection actors
