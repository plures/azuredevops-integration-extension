# Timer UI Fix Summary

## Issue

The timer was not incrementing after several minutes. The timer actor was initialized but not receiving TICK events to update elapsed time.

## Root Cause

The timer machine expects TICK events every second to update elapsed time, but these events were never being sent to the timer actor.

## Solution

### 1. Added Timer Tick Infrastructure

- Created a periodic tick interval in `initializeChildActors` that sends `TIMER_TICK` events every second
- The tick interval triggers the application machine to send TICK events to the timer actor

### 2. Event Flow

```
setInterval (every 1000ms)
  → sends TIMER_TICK event to application machine
  → application machine forwards TICK to timer actor (if running)
  → timer actor updates elapsed time
```

### 3. Timer State Exposure

- Enhanced `getSerializableContext()` to capture timer actor snapshot
- Timer state now flows to webview showing:
  - `workItemId` - active work item ID
  - `workItemTitle` - work item title
  - `elapsedSeconds` - elapsed time in seconds
  - `isPaused` - whether timer is paused
  - `state` - timer machine state

### 4. Webview Display

- Timer badge shows on work item cards with elapsed time
- Smart seconds display:
  - Shows seconds for first 30 seconds
  - Shows minutes after 30 seconds (e.g., "5m")
  - Hover over timer badge to show seconds
  - Seconds display for 30 seconds after hover ends

## Commits

1. `39bcf12` - fix: add TIMER_TICK event handler to update timer elapsed time
2. `dba7737` - fix: add timer tick events to update elapsed time
3. `a3e2d8f` - fix: update WorkItemList to use Svelte 5 runes mode
4. `af8a9f0` - feat(timer): add smart seconds display with hover interaction
5. `8cf4254` - feat: add timer UI to work item cards

## Testing

The timer should now:

- Start when clicking the Timer button on a work item
- Display elapsed time on the work item card
- Update every second showing the correct elapsed time
- Show smart formatting (seconds vs minutes)
- React to hover to show seconds

## Files Changed

- `src/activation.ts` - Added timer state to serializable context
- `src/webview/components/WorkItemList.svelte` - Added timer badge display
- `src/fsm/machines/applicationMachine.ts` - Added TIMER_TICK event handling

## Next Steps

1. Test timer functionality in VS Code
2. Implement Edit dialog feature
3. Implement Branch linking feature
