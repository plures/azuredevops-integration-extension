# Validation Checklist

## Overview

This checklist ensures the Azure DevOps Integration Extension meets all quality, security, and performance standards before release. All items must be completed and verified.

## Foundation Architecture Discipline ✅

### Validation Infrastructure

- [x] Architecture discipline documentation
- [x] TDD template and workflow
- [x] XState v5 validation script
- [x] Type-safe helpers for XState
- [x] ESLint rules for file size
- [x] Post-mortem analysis
- [x] **Fixed all 9 XState violations** across 3 machine files
- [x] **Build succeeds** without errors
- [x] **Validation passes** - all machines valid

### Test Infrastructure

- [x] Create `tests/features/` directory
- [x] Add vitest configuration
- [x] Write timer integration test (14 tests)
- [x] Verified test fails (RED phase) - caught missing RESTORE
- [x] Fixed until GREEN - all 14 tests passing
- [x] Discovered dynamic target syntax issue in XState v5
- [x] Fixed with guard-based transition array

### Module Extraction

- [x] Extract timer module into small files (< 300 lines each)
- [x] Create feature-based directory structure
- [x] Implement pure functions for persistence
- [x] Add co-located tests for utilities
- [x] Maintain single responsibility principle
- [x] **Extract Command Handlers module** from activation.ts (2,929 lines → modular)
- [x] **Extract Azure Client module** from azureClient.ts (1,535 lines → modular)
- [x] **Extract Connection Machine module** from connectionMachine.ts (1,316 lines → modular)
- [x] **Fix all parsing errors** in activation.ts (95 problems → 0 errors)
- [x] **Remove duplicate code** and old command registrations

### Pre-Commit Enforcement

- [x] Update `.husky/pre-commit` with validation checks
- [x] Add lint-staged configuration
- [x] Run XState validation before commit
- [x] Run feature tests before commit
- [x] Prevent broken code from entering git history

### Action Buttons Implementation

- [x] **Fixed Svelte deprecation warnings** (on:click → onclick, on:keydown → onkeydown)
- [x] **Added missing webview variables** (nonce, scriptUri, mainCssUri)
- [x] **Fixed webview loading error** - view now renders correctly
- [x] **Enhanced branch creation** with work item linking and comments
- [x] **Added in-VSCode edit dialog** for work items
- [x] **Improved timer state synchronization** between FSM and webview
- [x] **Added comprehensive error handling** for all action buttons
- [x] **Resolved build errors** - duplicate methods, file size limits
- [x] **Extension activation successful** - all features operational
- [x] **Added webview message handler** - critical fix for ALL button functionality
- [x] **Fixed timer state sync** - timer actor now broadcasts state to application context
- [x] **Fixed branch creation** - corrected synchronous getWorkItems usage
- [x] **Removed unused syncDataToWebview** - eliminated confusing dead code

### Quality Gates

- [x] All state machines pass validation
- [x] Timer feature has integration tests (14 tests)
- [x] Timer module extracted into small files
