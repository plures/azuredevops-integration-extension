## Current State Assessment

### Strengths

- âœ… ESM-first architecture with modern tooling
- âœ… Comprehensive test coverage (unit + integration)
- âœ… TypeScript throughout with strict type checking
- âœ… Svelte-based modern UI
- âœ… Security best practices implemented
- âœ… Proper CI/CD automation
- âœ… Extensive documentation

### Areas for Improvement

- ðŸ”„ Legacy JavaScript files still present (src/\*.js)
- ðŸ”„ Some test files may need ESM compatibility updates
- ðŸ”„ Documentation could be more comprehensive
- ðŸ”„ Performance monitoring could be enhanced

## Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development

1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Implement feature following TypeScript strict mode
3. Add comprehensive tests (unit + integration)
4. Update documentation
5. Run full test suite
6. Submit PR with conventional commits

### 2. Code Quality Gates

- All code must pass ESLint checks
- All code must be formatted with Prettier
- All tests must pass
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Security audit must pass

### 3. Release Process

1. Update version in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Run full test suite
4. Build and package extension
5. Create GitHub release
6. Publish to VS Code Marketplace

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: TypeScript (ESM-first)
- **Build Tool**: ESBuild
- **UI Framework**: Svelte
- **Testing**: Mocha + Chai
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Package Manager**: npm

## Performance Targets

- Activation time: < 100ms
- Command response time: < 500ms
- Webview load time: < 1000ms
- Memory usage: < 50MB

## Security Requirements

- Content Security Policy (CSP) compliance
- Secure PAT storage via VS Code secret store
- No remote network access from webview
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Input sanitization and validation

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Services, parsers, utilities
- Timer functionality
- Azure DevOps client operations
- Rate limiting logic

### Integration Tests

- Command registration and activation
- Webview communication
- End-to-end workflows
- Extension lifecycle

### Performance Tests

- Activation time measurement
- Memory usage monitoring
- API rate limiting validation

## Documentation Standards

- README.md: User-facing documentation
- ARCHITECTURE.md: Technical implementation details
- CHANGELOG.md: Version history
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Development guidelines
- Code comments: Inline documentation for complex logic

## Quality Metrics

- Test coverage: > 90%
- TypeScript strict mode: 100%
- ESLint compliance: 100%
- Security audit: No high/critical vulnerabilities
- Performance budgets: All targets met
