The most important settings you might want to configure:

```jsonc
{
  // Time tracking
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.defaultElapsedLimitHours": 3.5,
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.enableTimeTracking": true,

  // AI summaries
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.summaryProvider": "builtin", // or "openai"
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.openAiModel": "gpt-4o-mini",

  // Git integration
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.branchNameTemplate": "feature/{id}-{title}",
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.enableBranchCreation": true,

  // Work items
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.workItemsPerPage": 50,
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.enableAutoRefresh": true,

  // Debugging
  "azureDevOpsIntegration.debugLogging": false,
}
```

> **Note**: Personal Access Tokens are stored securely in VS Code's secret store, not in settings.json.

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Enable Debug Logging**: Set `azureDevOpsIntegration.debugLogging` to `true` in settings
2. **View Logs**: Run `Azure DevOps Integration: Open Logs` to see detailed diagnostics
3. **Copy Logs**: Use `Azure DevOps Integration: Copy Logs to Clipboard` to share logs for support

### Common Issues

| Issue                | Solution                                                        |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empty work item list | Verify organization/project settings and PAT scopes             |
| Timer not starting   | Ensure a work item is selected and no timer is already active   |
| PR creation fails    | Confirm PAT has Code (Read & Write) scope and repository exists |

## üì¶ Development

This extension is built with modern tooling and follows VS Code extension best practices:

- **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- **Svelte** for the webview UI components
- **ESBuild** for fast compilation
- **Comprehensive testing** with unit and integration tests

### Development Scripts

```bash
npm run build          # Build the extension
npm run test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests
npm run screenshots:capture # Generate documentation screenshots
```

### MCP Server

The repository includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for automation and agent integrations. See `mcp-server/README.md` for details.

## ü§ù Contributing

Pull requests welcome. Please open an issue first for substantial changes. Add tests where practical (client querying, timer edge cases) and keep logging minimal outside debug mode.
