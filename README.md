## üì¶ Development

This extension is built with modern tooling and follows VS Code extension best practices:

- **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- **Svelte** for the webview UI components
- **ESBuild** for fast compilation
- **Comprehensive testing** with unit and integration tests

### Development Scripts

```bash
npm run build          # Build the extension
npm run test           # Run unit tests
npm run test:integration # Run integration tests
npm run screenshots:capture # Generate documentation screenshots
```

### MCP Server

The repository includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for automation and agent integrations. See `mcp-server/README.md` for details.

## ü§ù Contributing

Pull requests welcome. Please open an issue first for substantial changes. Add tests where practical (client querying, timer edge cases) and keep logging minimal outside debug mode.
