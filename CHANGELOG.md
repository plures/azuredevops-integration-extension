# Change Log

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to the "Azure DevOps Integration" extension will be documented in this file.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [1.7.11] - 2025-10-01

### Changed

- **Activity Bar Icon Label**: Updated the Activity Bar icon title from "Azure DevOps" to "Azure DevOps Integration" for better clarity and consistency with the extension name.

## [1.7.10] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed

- **Connection Tabs Display**: Fixed bug where connection tabs were not appearing in the webview when multiple Azure DevOps connections/projects were configured. The webview now properly receives and displays connection tabs for switching between projects.
- **Per-Connection State Isolation**: Implemented connection-specific state management so each connection/project maintains its own independent query, filters (text, type, state, sort), and Kanban/List view preference. Switching between tabs now preserves the context for each connection.

### Technical

- Added `connectionsUpdate` message handler in webview to receive connection list from extension
- Implemented per-connection state storage using localStorage with in-memory caching
- Connection state persists across sessions and survives extension reloads
- Added visual tab UI matching VS Code's native tab styling when multiple connections exist

## [1.7.2] - 2025-09-24

### Added

- When stopping a timer, users can now choose to generate a Copilot prompt and copy it to the clipboard without stopping the timer. This allows for generating summaries of ongoing work.

### Changed

- The "Stop Timer" action now presents a quick pick menu with options to either stop the timer and apply time, or to generate a Copilot summary while the timer continues to run.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-09-23

### Changed

- **Svelte UI by Default**: The Svelte-based webview is now the default experience, removing the need for the `experimentalSvelteUI` feature flag. The legacy UI remains as a fallback if Svelte assets are missing.

### Fixed

- **PAT Storage**: Corrected an issue where the Personal Access Token (PAT) was not being consistently stored in the VS Code secret store after being updated via the setup command. The extension now reliably uses the secret store for PAT management.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.3] - 2025-09-20

## [1.7.0] - 2025-09-23

### Added

- Accessible keyboard Kanban navigation (Ctrl/Cmd + Arrow Left/Right moves focused work item between adjacent columns)
- Toast notification system with optimistic move feedback (success & error toasts, aria-live polite region)
- Codicon-based action icons replacing legacy emoji set for visual consistency with VS Code UI

### Changed

- Replaced emoji glyphs (play/stop/view/edit/comment/assignee/timer) with codicons and improved accessible labels
- Minor UI refinements to Kanban card actions and timer indicator styling

### Accessibility

- Added aria-label enhancements describing new keyboard move shortcut
- Toasts announced via aria-live and dismissible via close button

### Notes

- Dynamic per-type columns and additional tests scheduled for a follow-up release

### Improved

- Azure DevOps WIQL capability detection: remember if [System.StateCategory] is unsupported after the first 400 and automatically fallback to legacy state filters for the rest of the session. Reduces log noise and avoids repeat roundtrips.

### Notes

- No breaking changes. If your org supports [System.StateCategory], it will be used by default; otherwise the client will transparently adapt.
