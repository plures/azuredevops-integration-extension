## [1.9.3] - 2025-10-03

### Changed

- **Documentation screenshots**: Regenerated list and Kanban captures with a light theme backdrop so text remains readable and the README shows consistent framing across both views.

## [1.9.1] - 2025-10-03

### Changed

- **Entra ID scope updates**: Every Microsoft Entra connection now requests `offline_access` alongside the Azure DevOps resource scope so refresh tokens are issued for long-lived sessions.

### Fixed

## [1.7.10] - 2025-10-01

### Fixed

- **Connection Tabs Display**: Fixed bug where connection tabs were not appearing in the webview when multiple Azure DevOps connections/projects were configured. The webview now properly receives and displays connection tabs for switching between projects.
- **Per-Connection State Isolation**: Implemented connection-specific state management so each connection/project maintains its own independent query, filters (text, type, state, sort), and Kanban/List view preference. Switching between tabs now preserves the context for each connection.

### Technical

## [1.7.2] - 2025-09-24

### Added

- When stopping a timer, users can now choose to generate a Copilot prompt and copy it to the clipboard without stopping the timer. This allows for generating summaries of ongoing work.

### Changed

- The "Stop Timer" action now presents a quick pick menu with options to either stop the timer and apply time, or to generate a Copilot summary while the timer continues to run.

## [1.7.1] - 2025-09-23

### Changed

- **Svelte UI by Default**: The Svelte-based webview is now the default experience, removing the need for the `experimentalSvelteUI` feature flag. The legacy UI remains as a fallback if Svelte assets are missing.

### Fixed

- **PAT Storage**: Corrected an issue where the Personal Access Token (PAT) was not being consistently stored in the VS Code secret store after being updated via the setup command. The extension now reliably uses the secret store for PAT management.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Notes

- No breaking changes. If your org supports [System.StateCategory], it will be used by default; otherwise the client will transparently adapt.
