# packages/core

Platform-agnostic TypeScript core for:

- Azure DevOps REST client (axios)
- Timer state machine and elapsed cap
- Rate limiter and retry helpers
- Work item normalization and shared types

This package should have no VS Code or DOM dependencies. Adapters for storage/logging/live timers will be provided by each app.
